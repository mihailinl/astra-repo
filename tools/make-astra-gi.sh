# Lay out astra-gi.zip LOCALLY exactly as GAME-INTEGRATION-MANIFEST.md §3/§5 describe, from a local
# foundation build and a local BepInEx distribution — no CI needed to test the layout.
#
# Usage: tools/make-astra-gi.sh
#   FOUNDATION_DIR=<dir>   the foundation's Mono install folder, i.e. the content of
#                          BepInEx/plugins/Astra/ (default: ../astra-bepinex/artifacts/foundation-mono
#                          — build it there first with `tools/pack.sh`, from this repo's sibling checkout)
#   BEPINEX_DIST=<dir>     an unpacked BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.5.zip (default: ./bepinex-dist)
#   CONFIG=<Debug|Release> this repo's own build configuration to ship (default: Release)
#
# .github/workflows/release.yml does the same layout in CI, from a BepInEx zip it downloads and
# verifies by digest and a foundation release asset (still a TODO placeholder there — the
# foundation has no GitHub release yet).
